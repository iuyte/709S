Our mentors are the most amazing mentors **EVER!!!**

They exemplify kindness, leadership, and encourage us to approach problems in new, creative ways. Without them, we simply would not have a team. So, a big shoutout to our Mother and Father, Rick and Lisa, as well as our brother Parker, for their unending support and tolerance of our travels with robotics.

**NOTE:** Rick and Lisa did in fact earn the *Mentor of the Year Award* at the Northern New York State Championship! Spencer and I are firmly of the belief that they truly deserve it, for all that they do.
